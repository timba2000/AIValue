An enterprise automation and AI prioritization dashboard needs to solve one specific problem: **separating "cool ideas" from "high-value business cases."**

In an enterprise context, this dashboard serves as the bridge between technical feasibility and business strategy. It should allow stakeholders to compare a simple RPA bot against a complex Generative AI agent using a standardized scoring system.

Here is what I would expect to see, organized by strategic value.

---

### 1. The "North Star" Executive Summary
At the very top, you need high-level aggregates to justify the program's existence to the C-Suite.

* **Total Pipeline Value:** The sum of projected annual savings (cost reduction) + projected revenue uplift (growth) for all approved projects.
* **Hours Repurposed:** Instead of "hours cut," use "hours repurposed" to emphasize value-add.
* **Investment vs. Return (ROI):** Total estimated cost of implementation vs. expected financial return over 12–24 months.
* **Velocity:** Average time from "Idea" to "Production."

### 2. The Core Visualization: The Prioritization Matrix
This is the most critical visual on the dashboard. It usually takes the form of a 2x2 or 3x3 scatter plot.

* **X-Axis (Complexity):** A composite score of data readiness, integration difficulty, and change management effort.
* **Y-Axis (Value):** A composite score of FTE savings, revenue impact, and strategic alignment.
* **Bubble Size:** Estimated cost to build.
* **The Quadrants:**
    * **Top Left (Quick Wins):** High Value, Low Complexity. *Action: Fast-track these.*
    * **Top Right (Strategic Bets/Moonshots):** High Value, High Complexity. *Action: Fund carefully with strict milestones.*
    * **Bottom Left (Low Hanging Fruit):** Low Value, Low Complexity. *Action: Do only if resources are idle or for training.*
    * **Bottom Right (The Trap):** Low Value, High Complexity. *Action: Kill immediately.*

### 3. Detailed Scoring Metrics (The Data Table)
Below the visuals, you need a sortable table containing the specific metrics for each candidate use case.

| Metric Category | Specific KPIs to Display |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Business Impact** | **NPV (Net Present Value)**, Payback Period (months), Volume of Transactions, Error Reduction %. |
| **Technical Feasibility** | **Data Readiness Score** (Is the data structured/accessible?), Tech Maturity (Is this experimental GenAI or proven RPA?), Integration count. |
| **Risk & Governance** | **AI Risk Score** (Hallucination risk, bias, decision autonomy), PII/GDPR exposure level, Human-in-the-loop requirement. |
| **Change Management** | **Adoption Difficulty Score** (1-10), Number of employees affected, Process stability (Does the process change frequently?). |

### 4. Funnel & Status Tracking
To manage the workflow, you need a Kanban-style view or a funnel chart showing where ideas sit in the lifecycle.

1.  **Backlog/Ideation:** Unvetted ideas submitted by business units.
2.  **Assessment:** Currently undergoing technical and financial due diligence.
3.  **POC/Pilot:** Proving the concept on a small scale.
4.  **Development:** Full build in progress.
5.  **Production:** Live and generating value.
6.  **Retired/Rejected:** Ideas that failed assessment (important to keep these visible so people don't resubmit them).

### 5. "Resource & Bottleneck" View
An enterprise dashboard must highlight *why* projects aren't moving.

* **Availability Heatmap:** Availability of Data Scientists, RPA Developers, and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
* **Common Blockers:** A chart showing the top reasons for delays (e.g., "Waiting for InfoSec Approval," "Data Access Denied," "Budget Frozen").

### 6. Differentiating AI from Automation
In 2025, it is crucial to distinguish between **deterministic automation** (RPA) and **probabilistic AI** (GenAI/LLMs), as they have different risk profiles.

> **Pro Tip:** Add a toggle or color-coding to the dashboard to filter by technology type.
> * **Blue (RPA/Scripting):** High certainty, rules-based. Focus on *efficiency*.
> * **Purple (GenAI/ML):** Probabilistic, creative. Focus on *augmentation and experience*.

### 7. Post-Implementation Validation (The "Real" Numbers)
Most dashboards fail because they only show *projected* numbers. A mature enterprise dashboard includes a "Realized Value" section for projects that have been live for >3 months.

* **Projected vs. Actual ROI:** Did the bot actually save 1,000 hours, or did it only save 200?
* **Model Drift/Maintenance Cost:** The ongoing cost to keep the AI accurate (often ignored in initial planning).

### Summary of a Winning Dashboard Layout

1.  **Header:** High-level ROI and "Hours Repurposed" tickers.
2.  **Left Panel:** Filters (Department, Tech Type, Risk Level).
3.  **Center (Top):** The **Value vs. Complexity Matrix** (Scatter plot).
4.  **Center (Bottom):** The **Opportunity List** (Sortable table with Risk and Feasibility scores).
5.  **Right Panel:** Pipeline Funnel (Count of projects in each stage) and Resource Utilization.

**Would you like me to generate a weighted scoring rubric (math) for the "Complexity" and "Value" axes that you could use in Excel or PowerBI?**
